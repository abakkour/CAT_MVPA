# CAT_MVPA
This task code was used to run the experiment described in the publication:
Bakkour, A., Lewis-Peacock, J. A., Poldrack, R. A., & Schonberg, T. (2016). Neural mechanisms of cue-approach training. NeuroImage. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.09.059

To run the expriment: 

./run_boost_mvpa.sh

and follow on-screen prompts. Output files are placed in Output/ directory. Must have stim directory with stimulus images. We used stimuli from: Stimuli for Plassmann et al., J Neuro 2007 (positive junk foods, please cite Plassmann et al., 2007): http://www.rnl.caltech.edu/resources/index.html
